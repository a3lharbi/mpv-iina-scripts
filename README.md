# ðŸ“º mpv / iiNA Scripts
Some scripts to make life easier when using mpv and iina (mpv fork for OSX) 

## 1. [trueautosub.lua](https://github.com/fullmetalsheep/mpv-iina-scripts/blob/master/trueautosub.lua)
### True automatic subtitle downloading for mpv, works on OSX and Linux
This is a Improved fork of the [autosub](https://gist.github.com/selsta/ce3fb37e775dbd15c698) script by **selsta**. It Automatically downloads subtitles if they are not present using **subliminal**

**Make sure you have [subliminal](https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal) installed**

****Usage:****

1. Download **trueautosub.lua**
2. Copy to **~/.config/mpv/scripts/**
3. Open a video file using mpv, the subtitles will automatically get downloaded
4. If you got a wrongly synced sub, press **b**  or your customised shortcut to get another subtitle.Rinse and repeat until you find the proper sub :tada: 

**Note:** only tested on OSX, this should technically work with linux as well

> this is simply a lazy hack to make the script work the way its meant to be, all credits should go to the original author: [**selsta**](https://gist.github.com/selsta/ce3fb37e775dbd15c698).Absolutely no programming skills were involved in modifying this script.enjoy :)
